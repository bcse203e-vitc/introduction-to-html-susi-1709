    Web technology encompasses the tools, protocols, and languages used to build and interact with websites and web applications. 
    It includes everything from the markup languages like HTML and CSS that structure web pages to the programming languages like JavaScript, PHP, and Python that add functionality and interactivity. 
    Web technology also covers the servers that host websites, the browsers that display them, and the protocols like HTTP that govern communication.
